# <Module 1 Challenge Repo>

## Description

This project was done with the intention of cleaning up the Html and CSS. It originally was structured without html semantic structure and was filled with divs. Now that it has been cleaned up most divs have been converted into either "main", "aside", "section", "header", and "footer".

While making this project I learned how to:

* Code Html and CSS in semantic structure
* Link a .css file to a .html file
* Group problem solve
* Condense multiple .css commands into one class element

The original user story and acceptance criteria were as follows:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
